# Crowdfunding #
This Solidity-based Crowdsourcing Application is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to create and participate in crowdsourcing campaigns. The platform ensures transparency, security, and trust through smart contracts whilst also being thoroughly tested using Foundry's testing framework to ensure reliability and efficiency.

# Decentralised Autonomous Organisation #
This Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Platform is a decentralized governance system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to create and participate in autonomous organizations where decisions are made collectively through transparent and decentralized processes, not too dissimilar to Maker DAO. This project was developed in Solidity and also thoroughly tested using Foundry.

# Defi Stablecoin # 
Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a reference asset, such as fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR) or a commodity (e.g., gold). In this project, the prominent features of a stablecoin are exhibited via: 
1. Relative Stability: the stablecoin is anchored to the US Dollar (USD), ensuring that its value remains relatively stable compared to fiat currency. This stability is achieved through the use of a Chainlink price feed, which provides real-time price data for accurate valuation;
2. Stability Mechanism: The stability of the stablecoin is maintained through algorithmic means, making it a decentralized stablecoin. This approach ensures that the stability mechanism operates autonomously without the need for centralized control;
3. Collateralization Requirement: To mint the stablecoin, users must have sufficient collateral to back the value of the stablecoin. This requirement ensures that the stablecoin remains fully backed by assets, reducing the risk of volatility and maintaining stability; and
4. Exogenous Collateral: the stablecoin utilises exogenous collateral in the form of cryptocurrencies wrapped on the Ethereum blockchain. This includes:

- Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC): Bitcoin held on the Ethereum blockchain in a tokenized form, providing exposure to Bitcoin's value while benefiting from Ethereum's ecosystem.
- Wrapped Ethereum (WETH): Ethereum itself wrapped into an ERC-20 token, allowing it to be used in DeFi applications and providing liquidity to the stablecoin system.

# Non-Fungible Token #
An NFT project that is ready to be deployed to the relevant testnet but can also be called to change the user's NFT (i.e. MoodNft changing from a Happy emoji to a Sad emoji). This project is also accompanied by the relevant Foundry test suite. 

# Raffle #
The Raffle Project is an innovative platform that leverages blockchain technology to facilitate fair and transparent raffles and giveaways. It provides a secure and decentralized environment for hosting digital raffles, where participants have equal opportunities to win valuable prizes.

# Upgradeable contracts #
This smart contract template provides a basic implementation of an upgradeable smart contract using the UUPS standard. Upgradeability allows for updates and improvements to the contract's functionality without disrupting its state or losing user data. The UUPS standard is a universal proxy upgradeable standard proposed by OpenZeppelin.
